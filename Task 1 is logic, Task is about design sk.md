Task 1 is logic, Task is about design skills

download is yaml file, and download stoplight to run this on local machine

the question field is a field for the particular question type an employer wants to ask candidate, 
i.e Yes/No, Mutiple choice or date, it only shows up when they click on additional question
when they select the type, then they will also type the question, 
i.e Tell us about your previous experiences and the question type should be paragraph

the question types will come from the API, I have to think of how to most effectively send the data to the backend


UI design, no API intergration(the goal is the UI)

there's 3 options

option 1 is the application view

option 2 is the charts JS

option 3 is a more complex UI and require a lot of attention to detail

task 1 and 2 should be in two different public repo
